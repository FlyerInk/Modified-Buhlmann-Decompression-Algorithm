#Modified-Buhlmann-Decompression-Algorithm
This software calculates the decompression time for a set of pressure, tmeprature and heart rate data using a modified buhlmann decompression algorithm that takes in account the body's exertion

# UDive Software Test

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To compile and run:

1) type 'make' into command line while in correct directory. 

2) type './buhlmann inputs/input1.txt outputs/output1.txt tests/test1.txt'

3) The UDive Results will be output to the command line. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To view output file:

1) go to outputs folder 

2) open 'output1.txt'

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To edit input data:

1) Go to 'inputs' folder.

2) open 'input1.txt'

3) Edit the numeric value to desired weight (in lbs).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To edit sample data:

1) Go to 'tests' folder.

2) Open 'test1.txt' and changes recordings values.

3) these are ordered as follows: pressure (in bar), heart rate (in BPM), and temperature (in Farenheit).
